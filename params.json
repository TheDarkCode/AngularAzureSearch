DEMO SERVICES WILL THROTTLE PUBLIC USERS.\r\n\r\n####Current Live Demo Version: Build 17, 12/06/2015\r\n####Current Development Version: Build 18, 12/10/2015\r\n#####Status: \r\n  - WebRole works for User login/signup and Trails data CRUD operations. Confirm Email not tested. dlFramework still in development.\r\n  - WebAPI is fully working for Trails data and User accounts. (0 Errors, 0 Warnings) Support for dynamic partitioning is in-progress.\r\n  - DataIndexer is set to Trails data schema. Must configure via app settings config file. Will support bulk import in next update.\r\n\r\n######Upcoming Changes (Within Next 5 Builds):\r\n        1. Apache Cordova Sample Project using WebRole as base.\r\n        2. Azure ML sample integration to demonstrate how to use custom session parameters to automatically associate a user to a scoring profile or different index. ML web service calls will be made an endpoint in the Web API to avoid CORS issues.\r\n        3. Demonstrate Azure Search as a Web API endpoint.\r\n        4. Sample CRUD operations for documents that are partitioned across DocDB collections via Web API.\r\n        5. Dynamic routing, pagination of DocDB calls, data grids with sorting/filtering/search, and a sample page templates (with parallax) for WebRole.\r\n        6. Expanded DataIndexer with async I/O for bulk importing documents to DocDB. Dynamic index creation from input JSON schema with configurable option definitions (sortable/filterable, etc based on variable type - ex: string, geojson).\r\n        7. SignalR sample code in WebAPi project for showing real-time updates.\r\n        8. External Login Providers (Facebook / Twitter) and 2-factor authentication support (SendGrid/Twilio) via Web API.\r\n\r\n######Current To Do List:\r\n        Mapping Module Additions ::\r\n        1. Adding info boxes, mapType toggle, save (grab existing url, save to scope, export to User factory) / share search function (grab existing url, save to scope, display textbox with value, and select social button with baseUrl - Twitter, FB, Whatsapp, Email, etc), and add (toggleable) custom zoom controls. Also show # of pins if they are stacked close together when zoomed out (port PinClusterer - http://rtsinani.github.io/PinClusterer/).\r\n        2. Adding other standard shapes for searching by polygon (ie: square, circle).\r\n        3. Modifying CSS to create alternative theme(s). (Some prep work done in dlFramework)\r\n\r\n        Boilerplate ::\r\n        4. Updating to latest versions of angularjs, bootstrap, etc. (Angular 2? Bootstrap 4? Fonts and Icons to be continuously updated in future commits.)\r\n        5. Creating sample with AngularUI Router (ui-router) in place of ngRoute. (Low Priority)\r\n        6. Adding additional commenting. (Continuous)\r\n        7. Re-adding file merging / compilation (ie: generating a new site.js with full comments). (Will be added by Build 20)\r\n\r\n######Known Issues/Warnings:\r\n  - dlMenu animations do not render properly in all instances. Delayed in some cases.\r\n  - Url still contains filters and orderby parameters after leaving Homes page.\r\n  - Confirm Email not tested. Manage user account view will be resolved in next update.\r\n  - External login providers (Facebook / Twitter / Google / Microsoft) are not implemented yet. Will be added in the coming updates.\r\n  - Limitation for Cors is that it must have the correct URI syntax. Do not add \"www.\" if it is not necessary. Future updates will address this.\r\n  - Range and Lookup Partition Resolver Initializers are not completed yet. Spillover Resolver is not async.\r\n  - Multiple partitioning resolvers requires multiple clients. Current implementation is limited to a single resolver per client.\r\n  - External login support and autopopulating data/profile pictures from FB/Twitter accounts will be added in next round of updates.\r\n  - Interaction with Blob Storage to upload/download files is not completed. Still needs to be linked up with DocDB.\r\n\r\n####Azure Service Requirements for Deployment\r\n\r\nYou must configure the project with your own Azure Search Keys, Azure DocumentDB Database Connection Information, and Bing Maps API Keys.\r\n\r\n######If you are new to Azure, you can get a free trial at the following link: \r\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/\r\n\r\n######Bing Maps API (10k transactions/mo for free)\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/maps/Licensing/licensing.aspx#mainTab2\r\n\r\n######Azure Search Service are free excluding outbound data transfers (3 data connections / indexes / indexers, 50 MB Total Storage, 10,000 Documents).\r\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/search/\r\n\r\n######Azure DocumentDB requires at least an S1 plan ($25/mo = 250 RU/sec, 10 GB Storage) for each collection used (even empty ones).\r\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/documentdb/\r\n\r\n######Data Transfers Pricing Details\r\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/data-transfers/\r\n\r\n##Related GitHub Projects / Credits\r\n\r\n###Azure Search Demos by Liam Cavanagh, Microsoft\r\n######https://github.com/liamca/AzureSearchDemos\r\n######http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/search/\r\n\r\n###DocumentDb with Web API by Richard J.
