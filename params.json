Confirm Email not tested. dlFramework still in development.\r\n  - WebAPI is fully working for Trails data. (0 Errors, 0 Warnings) Currently in transition to add hash partitioning sample. User Accounts work 100%.\r\n  - DataIndexer is set to Trails data schema. Must configure via app settings config file.\r\n\r\n######Current To Do List:\r\n        Mapping Module Additions ::\r\n        1. Fixing touch events and layout for mobile users (ie: drawPolygon). (Touch events will be resolved in next update)\r\n        2. Adding info boxes, mapType toggle, save (grab existing url, save to scope, export to User factory) / share search function (grab existing url, save to scope, display textbox with value, and select social button with baseUrl - Twitter, FB, Whatsapp, Email, etc), and add (toggleable) custom zoom controls. Also show # of pins if they are stacked close together when zoomed out (port PinClusterer - http://rtsinani.github.io/PinClusterer/).\r\n        3. Adding other standard shapes for searching by polygon (ie: square, circle).\r\n        4. Modifying CSS to create alternative theme(s). (Some prep work done in dlFramework)\r\n\r\n        View Modifications ::\r\n        5. Creating a UI similar to Apartments.com with additional sample for all types of locations (not just homes). Example being to make an alternative that used people or businesses and their phone / address instead of homes.\r\n        6. Integrating it with a sample DocumentDB/Web API project for management of a DocumentDB \"Locations\" collection that is indexed by the search service.\r\n\r\n        Boilerplate ::\r\n        7. Updating to latest versions of angularjs, bootstrap, etc. (Angular 2? Bootstrap 4? Fonts and Icons to be continuously updated in future commits.)\r\n        8. Creating sample with AngularUI Router (ui-router) in place of ngRoute. (Low Priority)\r\n        9. Adding additional commenting. (Continuous)\r\n       10. Re-adding file merging / compilation (ie: generating a new site.js with full comments). (Will be added by Build 20)\r\n\r\n######Known Issues/Warnings:\r\n  - WebRole css issues with Firefox only impact Homes page currently.\r\n  - \"Homes\" page requires resize to trigger render of results/map. Does not render properly in all window sizes. Limited to anchorBottom issue. However in current build, renders on first load of page fine.\r\n  - \"Trails\" page is disabled. Will be resolved as part of \"Manage DocDB via Client\" updates (Build 16+).\r\n  - dlMenu animations do not render properly in all instances. Delayed in some cases.\r\n  - Url still contains filters and orderby parameters after leaving Homes page.\r\n  - Confirm Email not tested. Manage user account and logout functions will be resolved in next update.\r\n  - Existing template for geosearches are not configured for mobile.\r\n  - Build-related components for minifying WebRole's JS files are not included yet.\r\n  - Local cache causes issues when doing debugging. Thus new or reconfigured default routes may not render the appropriate template. During debug (when at localhost:port/index.html) it would either not render the ng-view or go to '/dashboard' when set to '/index'.\r\n  - Handling long usernames is partially fixed. Improvements will be made.\r\n  - External login providers (Facebook / Twitter / Google / Microsoft) are not implemented yet. Will be added in the coming updates.\r\n\r\n####Azure Service Requirements for Deployment\r\n\r\nYou must configure the project with your own Azure Search Keys, Azure DocumentDB Database Connection Information, and Bing Maps API Keys.\r\n\r\n######If you are new to Azure, you can get a free trial at the following link: \r\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/\r\n\r\n######Bing Maps API (10k transactions/mo for free)\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/maps/Licensing/licensing.aspx#mainTab2\r\n\r\n######Azure Search Service are free excluding outbound data transfers (3 data connections / indexes / indexers, 50 MB Total Storage, 10,000 Documents).\r\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/search/\r\n\r\n######Azure DocumentDB requires at least an S1 plan ($25/mo = 250 RU/sec, 10 GB Storage) for each collection used (even empty ones).\r\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/documentdb/\r\n\r\n######Data Transfers Pricing Details\r\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/data-transfers/\r\n\r\n##Related GitHub Projects / Credits\r\n\r\n###Azure Search Demos by Liam Cavanagh, Microsoft\r\n######https://github.com/liamca/AzureSearchDemos\r\n######http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/search/\r\n\r\n###DocumentDb with Web API by Richard J.
